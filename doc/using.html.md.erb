title: About the Greenplum Operator
---

After you install the Greenplum Operator, you can use it to deploy and manage Greenplum clusters. To interact with the Greenplum Operator, you place a set of instructions into a YAML-formatted configuration file (a Kubernetes _manifest_) and then use the `kubectl` utility to send the file instructions to the operator. The Greenplum Operator is then responsible for following the instructions that you provide, and also for maintaining the state of the Greenplum cluster according to the properties that you defined.

The following sections describe how to deploy a new Greenplum cluster and perform other common cluster administration tasks with <%=vars.product_name %>:
