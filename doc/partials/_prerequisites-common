* `kubectl` command-line utility. Install the version of `kubectl` that is distributed with VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) Edition, even if you are deploying Greenplum to Minikube. See [Installing the Kuberenetes CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/installing-kubectl-cli.html) in the VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) Edition documentation for instructions.

* Docker. Install a recent version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) to your machine, and start Docker.

* Helm package manager utility version 3.3 or later. Follow the instructions at [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) to install `helm`.

* VMware Tanzu Greenplum for Kubernetes requires the ability to map the host system's `/sys/fs/cgroup` directory onto each container's `/sys/fs/cgroup`. Ensure that no kernel security module (for example, AppArmor) uses a profile that disallows mounting `/sys/fs/cgroup`.

* The `watch` command-line utility is used to monitor the process of new deployments. If necessary, use your operating system package management utility to install this utility (for example, `brew install watch` on MacOS platforms).
